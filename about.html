            <h2>Hangtags</h2>
            <p>It's so nice to give some gifts to our loved ones, especially when it's their birthday, anniversary, graduation, or any other special days! However, we sometimes find it too "complicated" to place a card on their gift wraps. Sometimes, we just wanna hang the cards because we don't write anything too long, just the giver & receiver names with some short messages, that's where you need HANGTAGS!</p>
            <P>Hangtags are simple tags you can hang on the paper bag or parcel for your loved ones, or if you are giving away some snack parcels for your child's birthday. Hangtags or similar to cards but much more simpler! With aesthetic handmade designs, you no need to worry about being too basic.</P>
